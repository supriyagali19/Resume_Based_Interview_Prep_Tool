# Resume_Based_Interview_Prep_Tool_Using_AgenticAI


[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

An AI-powered tool that analyzes your resume and job title to generate tailored interview questions and resources. It also provides real-time feedback (summarized at the end) on your communication skills and body language during a practice session using your webcam and microphone.

## About The Project

This project aims to help users prepare effectively for job interviews. It streamlines preparation by:
1.  Analyzing an uploaded resume (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and a target job title.
2.  Generating relevant AI-powered interview questions (technical, behavioral, situational).
3.  Fetching related online resources (articles, guides) based on the job title.
4.  Running a background session using the webcam and microphone to analyze communication (via transcription) and body language (via pose estimation).
5.  Providing summary feedback on communication clarity, confidence, filler words, posture stability, and presence after the session completes.

### Built With

* **Language:** Python
* **Frontend/UI:** Streamlit
* **AI/ML:**
    * LLM: Groq (Meta Llama 4 Maverick 17B Instruct via `langchain-groq`)
    * Transcription: Groq (Whisper Large v3)
    * Embeddings: Sentence Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
    * Computer Vision: OpenCV, MediaPipe (Pose)
* **Audio Processing:** SoundDevice, SoundFile
* **File Parsing:** PyPDF2, python-docx
* **Web Scraping:** Requests, Beautiful Soup 4
* **Concurrency:** threading, queue
* **(Optional) Vector Database:** Milvus (`pymilvus`)

## Features

* Parses resumes in PDF, DOCX, and TXT formats.
* Generates tailored interview questions using Groq LLM based on resume content and job title.
* Fetches relevant online interview preparation links via DuckDuckGo search.
* Captures audio via microphone and transcribes it using Groq Whisper.
* Captures video via webcam and analyzes body language using MediaPipe (detects posture shifts, head movement, face visibility).
* Provides end-of-session summary feedback on communication skills and body language presence, generated by Groq LLM.
* (Optional) Stores resume text and sentence embeddings in a local Milvus database for potential future use.
* Simple web interface provided by Streamlit.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running locally.

### Prerequisites

* **Python:** Version 3.8+ recommended (based on library usage).
* **pip:** Python package installer.
* **Git:** For cloning the repository.
* **Groq API Key:** You MUST obtain an API key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys) and set it as an environment variable (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).
* **Webcam & Microphone:** Required for the real-time analysis features.
* **(Optional) Milvus:** If you want to use the resume storage feature, you need a Milvus instance running locally (default connection: `localhost:19530`). See [Milvus documentation](https://milvus.io/docs/install_standalone-docker.md) for setup instructions. If you don't have Milvus, the script should still run but will disable Milvus features.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/supriyagali19/Resume_Based_Interview_Prep_Tool.git](https://github.com/supriyagali19/Resume_Based_Interview_Prep_Tool.git)
    cd Resume_Based_Interview_Prep_Tool
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    # On Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # On macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Create a file named `requirements.txt` in the project directory with the following content:
    ```txt
    streamlit
    requests
    beautifulsoup4
    pypdf2
    python-docx
    sentence-transformers
    opencv-python
    numpy
    sounddevice
    soundfile
    mediapipe
    groq
    langchain-groq
    langchain-core
    # Optional: Milvus client - uncomment if you have Milvus running
    # pymilvus>=2.4.0
    ```
    Then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Set Environment Variable:** Make sure the `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable is set (see below).

## Usage

1.  **Ensure Prerequisites are met** (especially the `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable).
2.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
3.  Your web browser should automatically open to the application's URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
4.  **Upload your resume** (PDF, DOCX, or TXT).
5.  **Enter the target job title.**
6.  **Click the "Start Analysis" button.**
7.  The application will run the `Main.py` script in the background. This involves:
    * Parsing the resume.
    * Generating questions and fetching resources (these will appear first in the Streamlit app).
    * Starting webcam and microphone capture for real-time analysis (this runs in the background; the `Main.py` script might attempt to open its own window, but the Streamlit app indicates the video feed won't show *within Streamlit*).
    * Transcribing speech and analyzing body language.
8.  **Wait for the script to finish** (it runs for a set duration, default 5 minutes, or until 'stop analysis' is spoken, or 'q' is pressed if the OpenCV window appears and is focused).
9.  Once finished, the **Communication Summary** and **Body Language Summary** sections will appear in the Streamlit interface.
10. The full output log from `Main.py` is also available in the Streamlit app.

## Environment Variables

This project requires the following environment variable to be set:

* `GROQ_API_KEY`: Your API key for Groq services (LLM and Transcription).

You can set environment variables in your operating system, or by using a `.env` file and a library like `python-dotenv` (though `python-dotenv` is not currently listed in requirements).

Example (setting temporarily in Linux/macOS terminal):
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY='your_groq_api_key_here'
streamlit run app.py

Example (setting temporarily in Windows Command Prompt):
```cmd
set GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
streamlit run app.py
Example (setting temporarily in Windows PowerShell):

PowerShell

$env:GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
streamlit run app.py
For persistent storage, configure it in your system's environment variable settings.
